The solution involves a meticulous review of the project's dependencies and configurations. The vague nature of the error makes it necessary to systematically check each component:

1. **Dependency Conflicts:** Carefully examine `package.json` and identify potential dependency conflicts. Use a tool like `npm ls` or `yarn why` to analyze the dependency tree. Resolve any conflicts by updating or removing problematic packages.
2. **Configuration Files:**  Inspect `app.json` (or `expo.json`) for any potential configuration errors or inconsistencies. Pay close attention to settings related to builds, assets, and platforms.
3. **Expo SDK Version:** Ensure you're using a compatible and stable version of the Expo SDK. Update if needed, carefully following the upgrade instructions provided by Expo.
4. **Clean and Rebuild:** Thoroughly clean the project and rebuild. Sometimes cached files can interfere with the build process.  The exact commands to clean vary depending on the environment. 
5. **Reproducible Example:** If possible, create a minimal, reproducible example that demonstrates the error. Isolating the problem makes it easier to diagnose. 

Example Code (Illustrative): 

//bug.js (Example demonstrating potential dependency conflict)
import React from 'react';
import SomeConflictingLibrary from 'some-conflicting-library'; //This might be a conflicting dependency

const App = () => {
  return (
    <View>
      <Text>Hello World!</Text>
    </View>
  );
};

//bugSolution.js
import React from 'react';
// Removed or replaced the conflicting dependency

const App = () => {
  return (
    <View>
      <Text>Hello World!</Text>
    </View>
  );
};

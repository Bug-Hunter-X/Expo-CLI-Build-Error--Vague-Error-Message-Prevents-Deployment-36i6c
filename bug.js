While developing a React Native application using Expo CLI, I encountered an unusual error during the build process. The error message was vague and unhelpful, providing no specific details about the cause of the problem. The error appeared consistently across different platforms (Android and iOS), leading me to believe the issue was not platform-specific but rather related to a deeper configuration problem or unexpected behavior within the Expo CLI itself. This was problematic because it made debugging exceptionally difficult and time-consuming.  The error prevented the app from successfully building, halting the deployment process. The lack of detailed information in the error message made it challenging to pinpoint the root cause efficiently.  I've tried clearing the cache, reinstalling Expo, and checking all my dependencies, yet the problem persists.
